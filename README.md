# F21MP-Autonomous-Vehicle-Traffic-Simulation



## Introduction
This project, developed as part of the F21MP Masters Project and Dissertation, aims to create an autonomous vehicle agent that can navigate through a simulated traffic environment using Unity's ML-Agents.


### Project Aims
- Develop a vehicle agent in Unity capable of autonomous navigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
- Implement a traffic simulation within Unity to test and train the autonomous vehicle agent.
